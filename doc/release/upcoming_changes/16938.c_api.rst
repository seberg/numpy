Size of ``np.ndarray`` and ``np.void_`` changed
-----------------------------------------------
The size of the ``PyArrayObject`` and ``PyVoidScalarObject``
structures have changed.  This also modifies the header
definition::

    #define NPY_SIZEOF_PYARRAYOBJECT (PyArray_Type.tp_basicsize)

since the size should not be considered a compile time constant.

In the case that your code subclasses any of these on the C-level,
it will have to be recompiled and should add guards against such
size changes for the future.  NumPy will attempt to give a graceful
warning, but in many cases crashes are likely if this is done.

We are not aware of any user impacted by this change. If your
project is, please get in touch with the NumPy developers.
