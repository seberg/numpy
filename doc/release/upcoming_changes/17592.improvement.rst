Change in the string representation of `numpy.bool_` scalars
------------------------------------------------------------
To avoid ambiguity with the string representation of the builtin constants
`True` and `False`, `numpy.bool_` scalars now have a string representation of
``numpy.True_`` and ``numpy.False_``.
The printing of boolean *arrays*, however, is unchanged.
