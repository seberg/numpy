Cyclic garbage collection support
---------------------------------
NumPy arrays now supports cyclic garbage collection.
Most importantly this means that situations such as::

    arr = np.array([None], dtype=object)
    arr[0] = arr
    del arr

can be cleaned up by the garbage collector. While support has
been added, it is generally advisable to avoid such constructs.
